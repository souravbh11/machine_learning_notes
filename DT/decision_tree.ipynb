    "\n",
    "Splitting Criteria: At each internal node, the decision tree algorithm chooses the best feature to split the data based on certain criteria. The goal is to find the feature that best separates the data into purest possible subsets in terms of the target variable (class label or predicted value). The purity of the subsets is typically measured using metrics like Gini impurity, entropy, or classification error rate.\n",

    "Recursive Partitioning: The algorithm recursively partitions the data based on the selected feature and its possible values. This process continues until certain stopping criteria are met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth, having nodes with fewer than a specified number of data points, or no further improvement in purity can be achieved by splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Making: Once the tree is built, to make a prediction for a new instance, it traverses the tree from the root node down to a leaf node. At each internal node, it evaluates the feature value of the instance and follows the corresponding edge based on the decision rule. This process continues until a leaf node is reached, and the class label (or predicted value) associated with that leaf node is returned as the prediction.\n",
